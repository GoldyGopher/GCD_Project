The tidy data set is summarized by Activity and Subject.  Note - Did not group by "Test" vs "Train"

There are 6 levels of Activity Label:
STATIC - LAYING
STATIC - SITTING
STATIC - STANDING
WALKING - DOWNSTAIRS
WALKING - LEVEL
WALKING - UPSTAIRS

There are 30 different subjects that participated in the experiment:

1:30

The mean and STD of mulitple parameters are summarized and included in the tidy data set.  79 variables are summarized.

These variables are

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean


In all cases, any mean, STD or mean freq are collected to total 79 columns of data.

Sorry, but I have no clue what the units are for each measurement.
